Using LIBSVM in MATLAB/Octave

In the optional section of this exercise, Prof Ng recommended that we use LIBSVM to solve the problem.

Installing LIBSVM on MATLAB/Octave is very easy.

    After downloading and unzipping the LIBSVM package, open MATLAB/Octave.
    Go to the directory of the MATLAB/Octave version, e.g. "E:/CourseraML/machine-learning-ex6/ex6/libsvm-3.21/matlab"
    Enter "make" in the command window.
    That's it! You're done! Now read the README file in the MATLAB directory, and learn how to use svmtrain and svmpredict function.
    In short, the syntax of these two functions are:model = svmtrain( trainingLabelVector, trainingInstanceMatrix [, 'libsvmOptions'])[predictedLabel, accuracy, decisionValues/probEstimates] = svmpredict( testingLabelVector, testingInstanceMatrix, model [, 'libsvmOptions']);
