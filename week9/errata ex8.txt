Error in ex8_cofi.m

There is an error in the ex8_cofi.m script. In Part 7, around line 200, the code that calls fmincg() and cofiCostFunc() should use the Ynorm variable, instead of Y.

Figure 4 in ex8.pdf is also incorrect - no movies should have ratings higher than 5.

This issue is also documented in the Errata lists in the Resources menu.
